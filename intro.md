I'm **Brandon Nguyen**, a Ph.D student at the University of Michigan.
I joined Professor Scott Mahlke's group [Compilers Creating Custom Processors](http://cccp.eecs.umich.edu) in Fall 2018.

I'm currently also the primary instructor for [EECS 201: Computer Science Pragmatics](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs201/).

I graduated from The University of Texas in Spring 2018, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with
a focus on computer architecture and embedded systems and a secondary focus on digital signal processing.
