*This post is a copy from my old website and blog. I have kept its original post date.*

It’s been about a month since my last post: there’s been a lot going on with school
(and my “hibernation” during spring break).

So on March 15, 2018 I got an email from the University Recruiting team about how the
hiring manager has started the offer process for me. Yay! I have a job this summer!
