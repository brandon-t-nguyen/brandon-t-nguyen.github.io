*This post is a copy from my old website and blog. I have kept its original post date.*

So I'm currently taking EE 382N.4 Advanced Micro-Controller Systems at UT, taught by Dr. Mark McDermott.
The class revolves around working wiht a ZedBoard, which has a Xilinx Zynq-7020 SoC combining
two ARM Cortex-A9 cores with an FPGA, where we learn to write hardware accelerators and integrate
them into a Linux system.

As part of this, we've been given the binary and source of a nifty set of programs that Dr. McDermott
wrote that are able to print out (or put a value at) values from provided physical addresses.
The kicker is that we'll have to write a program that will write to the registers of a device
on the FPGA that has to replicate the behavior of this set of programs.

I decided to write a library that abstracts this process and provides a clean interface to perform this in:
no need to directly muck about with mmap() and such, and have called it "libmem" in honor of
it using the `/dev/mem` device.
