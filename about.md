{% include_relative intro.md %}

I was the GSI for EECS 270 in Fall 2018 and Winter 2019 at UMich,
as well as an undergrad TA for BME 303, EE 319K, EE 312, and EE 422C at UT Austin.

I have interned at NVIDIA for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 summers. In 2016 I was
on the Tegra SW Camera Controls team, in 2017 the Tegra SW Camera Performance team, and in 2018
the Linux/\*nix GPU driver team. I have to say I learned a bunch about
how complex these drivers can be over these three summers.

I enjoy working on personal projects, especially if they involve low-level components
like hardware and drivers, and am currently working on a better toolchain for
the LC-3 educational ISA. Besides the technical stuff I enjoy sport shooting
(e.g. multi-gun and IDPA), HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts), and modern fencing.
